# Deep Tsundoku

## Vision

Deep Tsundoku is a bookshelf app for augmenting the serendipity of physical book browsing with modern information retrieval.

There is a certain joy when fossicking for books, whether in a library, used bookstore, or indie shop, and coming across a literary treasure. However, one usability issue of bookstores is that the number of books might be overwhelming and there is no easy way to "judge a book by its cover" and know if a book is worth your time. Compared to online shopping, we might not remember if we had come across the book before and added it to a wishlist.

Is one of the books I wanted to read on the bookshelf? Will I like this book? Why should I read this certain book? This app aims to answer these questions.

## Roadmap
- (phase 0) retrain title-author model on higher resolution
- (phase 0) batch predictions from set of segmented images at inference time
- (phase 0) adapt [synthdog](https://github.com/clovaai/donut/tree/master/synthdog) for creating synthetic bookspine images
- (phase 1) introduce cutoff for recommend/don't recommend instead of just ranking
- (phase 1) try LinkedIn's [DeText](https://github.com/linkedin/detext) framework for language-based ranking to help with books not in the product-product graph

## Credits
- Lakshya Khatri's [work](https://github.com/LakshyaKhatri/Bookshelf-Reader-API) on spine detection was helpful in writing our segmenter
- Clova AI's [donut](https://github.com/clovaai/donut) (document understanding transformer) model serves as the architecture that we fine-tune for book detection
- Nils Reimers and Iryna Gurevych's [Sentence-BERT](https://www.sbert.net/) is used for our title string vector search
- Eugene Yan's recommender system [blogposts](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/recommender-systems-graph-and-nlp-pytorch/) and his other [writings](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/system-design-for-discovery/) on recsys generally were helpful in building the first version of our recommendation system
